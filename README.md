# Installation

```
Asking users to share a user token is forbidden by our Developer Policy and may result in action taken against your app and/or account. Please don't take that approach.
 
We may someday have other ways of setting presence on mobile, but for now it's really just the one method, which the game developers will need to pursue themselves if interested.
 
Thanks,
Shipwreck

```diff
- IF YOU ARE WANT TO GET EXPERIMENTAL EVEN AFTER THAT.
- I HEAVILY CONSIDER USING PLUGIN MANAGER AND DISABLE 2FA, LOGIN THEN ENABLE IF YOU WANT 2FA FOR YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT(MOBILE USERS!!!)

```
For desktop just copy the `desktop_rpc.py `to the mods folder and you are good to go.
For mobile download `mobile_rpc.py` and move it to the mods folder then go to`Settings->Advanced->Plugins->Settings` Find the mobile_rpc settings then just login.
